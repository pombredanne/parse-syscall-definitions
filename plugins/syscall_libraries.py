<Purpose>
  The program asks for a pickle file containing a set of system call 
  definitions. Then the program examines a set of python libraries and checks
  whether these libraries contain functions corresponding to these system calls.

  An order of the libraries can be optionally set. If the order is not set, then
  each library will be examined individually for whether it contains these
  system calls. This means that a system call can appear in more than one
  library. If the order is set, then the libraries will be examined in that
  order, and each system call will appear only once, in the library first met.

  <Purpose>
    Given a set of libraries and a set of system calls, examine which system
